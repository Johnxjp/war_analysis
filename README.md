# war_analysis
Simple statistical analysis of the card game war.

With this program you can plot the means number of turns or how the winner's hand evolves over a course of a game when the game is played under two different conditions:
  a) cards won are shuffled before putting at the bottom of the winner's hand
  b) cards won are not shuffled before putting at the bottom of the winner's hand
